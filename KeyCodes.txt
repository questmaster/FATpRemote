Funny you should ask....

 

Here's the commands from the earlier NetRemote app (circa FW2.20), but as Seagate are still directing non-US users to that version even for FW 2.23, I imagine the commands are the same. Still anxiously awaiting the newer Seagate branded app to see if there's more fun to be had.

 

Commands are 4 bytes sent to TCP port 9999 of the format

48 12 XX 00

(HEXADECIMAL!)

 

where XX varies for each command thus:

 

07: left
06: right
40: up
41: down
1B: back
30: end >>|
51: ff >>
39: home
47: info
1A: menu
59: mute
0E: ok
54: stop
4F: play/pause
38: power
52: rew <<
31: start |<<
33: voldown
32: volup
35: zoomin
08: zoomout

06: right
07: left
08: zoomout
0E: ok
1A: menu
1B: back
30: end >>|
31: start |<<
32: volup
33: voldown
35: zoomin
38: power
39: home
40: up
41: down
47: info
4F: play/pause
51: ff >>
52: rew <<
54: stop
59: mute

 
Hope the names make sense. This was culled from a batch file I quickly wrote a few weeks ago to test out the theory and I just made up names for the keys on the remote. Couldn't be bothered looking up the manual to find out if Seagate actually named the keys. Given the accuracy of the rest of the manual, it probably refers to them as QWERTY ;-)

Couple of questions for people who own the Iphone version ...
1) Does anybody know how the search feature works?
2) Has/Can anyone with an iphone find out what command it sends to get the movie list?
3) Also what it sends for key presses on the keyboard would also be nice. 
to1) No idea. Haven't been able to test this.
to2) 48 12 fe 00 -> SQLite Database(though no idea what gets sent back as all my testing was with 2.20 which doesn't support this feature)
to3) 48 12 f9 41 is 'A' - replace the last byte with the ASCII code for the character you want. My tests with sending Japanese Unicode characters have been a total failure. So far I have successfully tested only the characters in the Anglo-centric 7-bit ASCII set, though the Euro-centric 8-bit Latin character set, probably works. Es tut mir leid.
